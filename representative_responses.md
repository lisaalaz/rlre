| No attack | In the first year, the startup invested $8000.<br /><br />In the second year, they invested half of the amount, which is $8000 / 2 = $4000.<br /><br />Over the two years, the total amount invested is $8000 + $4000 = $12000.<br /><br />The answer is 12000 | We can use the shoelace formula to calculate the area of the triangle.<br /><br />The formula is given by $$&#124;\det(L)&#124;/2,$$ where $L$ is a matrix whose columns are the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.<br /><br />For a triangle with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2),$ and $(x_3, y_3),$ the determinant $L$ is given by $$L = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.$$<br /><br />Plugging in the values, we get $$L = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\ 3 & 3 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.$$<br /><br />The determinant of $L$ is $\det(L) = -(3-(-1))(-3-1) + (0(-1)) = 14.$<br /><br />Therefore, the area of the triangle is $$&#124;\det(L)&#124;/2 = \boxed{7}\.$$. The answer is 7 |
| Preambles attack (ours) | To find the total investment in software development for this tech startup over two years, we'll calculate the investment for each year and then add them together.<br /><br />**Year 1:**<br />- Investment in software development = $$\text{\textdollar}8000$$.<br /><br />**Year 2:**<br />- The investment in software development is half of the first-year investment, so it's $$\text{\textdollar}8000 \div 2 = \text{\textdollar}4000$$.<br /><br />**Total Investment in Software Development:**<br />- The total investment across both years is the sum of the investments in both years: $$\text{\textdollar}8000 + \text{\textdollar}4000 = \boxed{\text{\textdollar}12,000}$$.<br /><br />Therefore, the startup invested a total of $$\text{\textdollar}12,000$$ in software development over the two years. | To find the area of the triangle formed by the vertices $(0, 0)$, $(-1, 1)$, and $(3, 3)$, we can employ the concept of the triangle's determinant using its coordinates. Here's a step-by-step explanation:<br /><br />1. **Identify Triangle's Vertices:** We have three vertices: $(0, 0)$, $(-1, 1)$, and $(3, 3)$.<br /><br />2. **Calculate Determined Area:** The area of a triangle, often denoted as $$\Delta = \frac{1}{2} \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix},$$ where $(x_i, y_i)$ are the coordinates of the vertices. In our case: - $x_1 = 0, y_1 = 0$ - $x_2 = -1, y_2 = 1$ - $x_3 = 3, y_3 = 3$.<br /><br />3. **Substitute and Calculate:** Plugging in the values: $$\Delta = \frac{1}{2} \begin{vmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\ 3 & 3 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \left( 0 - (-1) + 3 \right) \sqrt{(0 - (-1))^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = \boxed{10}\, \text{ square units}.$$<br /><br />4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the area of the triangle is $$\boxed{10 \text{ square units}}.$$ |
